     Classification and Tagging System for Digital Content to 
              Preserve Clean Datasets for Machine Learning
                 draft-williams-ai-content-tagging-00


Abstract

   This document specifies a classification and tagging system designed
   to identify and preserve the provenance of digital content (text,
   audio, video, and other media) to ensure the integrity of training
   datasets for machine learning systems.  The framework described
   herein aims to support a standardized mechanism for tagging data
   with metadata that specifies whether the content was human-generated
   or AI-generated.  This enables the exclusion of AI-generated data
   from training corpora where human-originated material is required,
   and it facilitates the maintenance of clean, verifiable sources for
   future AI development.

1.  Introduction

   With the proliferation of generative AI models producing vast
   amounts of synthetic content, it is increasingly difficult to ensure
   the quality and originality of training datasets for future AI
   systems.  This phenomenon, commonly referred to as "model collapse"
   or "data poisoning," occurs when models are trained on outputs of
   other models, compounding errors and losing alignment with human-
   authored knowledge and intent.

   As Rear Admiral Grace Hopper stated in her 1982 NSA address, every
   data record must include an identifier.  In keeping with this
   foundational principle, this RFC proposes a metadata-based
   classification system that can be attached to digital content at the
   time of its creation or publication to ensure traceability,
   discoverability, and reliability.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   HGC (Human-Generated Content):  Data or media created entirely by
      human effort, without the use of AI assistance.

   AIGC (AI-Generated Content):  Content generated in part or in full
      by artificial intelligence systems.

   Metadata Tag:  An identifier attached to content that specifies
      generation origin, timestamp, authorship, and optional
      cryptographic signature.

Internet-Draft       AI Content Classification System         June 2025


   Clean Dataset:  A dataset composed exclusively of HGC, validated for
      provenance and integrity.

3.  Metadata Structure

   Each piece of digital content MUST be accompanied by a metadata
   record conforming to the following schema:

   version:  The version of this metadata specification.

   origin:  Identifies the method of content generation.  Valid values
      are "human", "ai", or "hybrid".  "Hybrid" indicates partial AI
      involvement.

   author:  The creator or generating entity of the content.

   creation_timestamp:  ISO 8601 formatted timestamp of content
      creation.

   license:  The licensing terms under which the content is
      distributed.

   checksum:  SHA-256 hash of the content for integrity verification.

   signature:  Optional cryptographic signature for validation.
      RECOMMENDED for human content to validate integrity via digital
      signature.

   toolchain:  Optional field indicating the tools or AI models used
      in content generation.

   model_identifier:  Optional field specifying the specific AI model
      used for AIGC.

4.  Implementation Mechanisms

   The metadata MAY be embedded using one or more of the following
   methods:

   *  HTTP headers (e.g., X-Content-Metadata)

   *  Sidecar XML files for downloadable assets

   *  Embedded tags within HTML meta elements

   *  ID3v2 tags for MP3/MP4 audio files

   *  Exif/XMP tags for image and video files

Internet-Draft       AI Content Classification System         June 2025


5.  Implementation Examples

5.1.  HTTP Header for Human-Generated HTML Page

   The following example shows the HTTP header format for a human-
   generated HTML page:

   GET /article.html HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   ...
   X-Content-Metadata: <metadata><version>1.0</version><origin>human</o
   rigin><author>Jane Doe</author><creation_timestamp>2025-06-21T08:00
   :00Z</creation_timestamp><license>CC-BY-4.0</license><checksum>3d2e
   61...</checksum><signature>BASE64_PGP_SIGNATURE</signature></metada
   ta>

5.2.  Sidecar File for Image

   For an image file named "sunrise.jpg", the accompanying sidecar
   metadata file would be "sunrise.jpg.meta.xml":

   <metadata>
     <version>1.0</version>
     <origin>ai</origin>
     <author>AI Art Generator</author>
     <creation_timestamp>2025-06-20T19:23:00Z</creation_timestamp>
     <checksum>abc456...</checksum>
     <toolchain>StableDiffusion-v3</toolchain>
     <model_identifier>sd-v3.1</model_identifier>
   </metadata>

5.3.  HTML Meta Tags

   The following example shows HTML meta tag implementation:

   <meta name="X-Content-Origin" content="human">
   <meta name="X-Content-Author" content="John Smith">
   <meta name="X-Content-Timestamp" content="2025-06-22T12:34:00Z">
   <meta name="X-Content-Signature" content="BASE64_SIGNATURE">

5.4.  Audio File with ID3 Tags

   For audio files, the following ID3v2 tags SHOULD be used:

   *  TXXX:Content-Origin = "human"

   *  TXXX:Content-Author = "Podcast Host"

   *  TXXX:Toolchain = (not present for human-generated content)

   *  TXXX:Checksum = "8f3a2b..."

Internet-Draft       AI Content Classification System         June 2025


6.  Trust and Verification

   Verification SHOULD be achieved through the following mechanisms:

   *  Public key infrastructure (PKI) for digital signature validation

   *  Trust registries for known human content sources

   *  Canonical checksums published to public hash registries

   Content consumers SHOULD verify signatures and checksums when
   available to ensure the integrity and authenticity of metadata
   claims.

7.  Application to Machine Learning Pipelines

   Dataset construction pipelines MUST implement the following
   requirements:

   *  Filter and exclude content with origin values of "ai" or "hybrid"
      where HGC-only datasets are mandated

   *  Retain metadata lineage for dataset auditing and transparency

   *  Support backtracking of samples to their original signed content

   *  Maintain logs of all filtering decisions for compliance and
      auditing purposes

8.  Security Considerations

   Several security considerations apply to this specification:

   *  Malicious actors may attempt to falsify metadata.  Digital
      signatures, cryptographic checksums, and origin auditing are
      necessary to prevent tampering.

   *  Repositories SHOULD maintain audit logs of metadata ingestion and
      content origin verification.

   *  The integrity of the metadata itself must be protected through
      cryptographic means where authenticity is critical.

   *  Trust anchors and certificate authorities used for signature
      verification must be carefully managed and regularly audited.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   Privacy protections must be considered in the implementation of this
   system:

   *  Personally identifiable information (PII) SHOULD NOT be embedded
      in metadata.

   *  Where authorship must be asserted, anonymized or pseudonymous
      cryptographic identities SHOULD be used.

   *  Content creators must have control over what identifying
      information is included in metadata tags.
