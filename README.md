AI Content Classification and Tagging System
IETF Internet-Draft: Classification and Tagging System for Digital Content to Preserve Clean Datasets for Machine Learning
Abstract
This document specifies a classification and tagging system designed to identify and preserve the provenance of digital content (text, audio, video, and other media) to ensure the integrity of training datasets for machine learning systems. The framework described herein aims to support a standardized mechanism for tagging data with metadata that specifies whether the content was human-generated or AI-generated.

Current Status

Document: draft-williams-ai-content-tagging-00
Status: Internet-Draft (Work in Progress)
Date: June 2025
Author: Keenan Williams
Category: Standards Track

Implementation
Reference Implementation: ai-content-tagging-tools
A complete working implementation demonstrating:

âœ… CLI tools for content tagging and validation
âœ… Web interface for drag-and-drop file processing
âœ… Express.js middleware for automatic header injection
âœ… Multi-format support (XML sidecars, HTTP headers, HTML meta tags)
âœ… Cryptographic integrity verification (SHA-256)
âœ… RFC-compliant metadata schema

Problem Statement
With the proliferation of generative AI models producing vast amounts of synthetic content, it is increasingly difficult to ensure the quality and originality of training datasets for future AI systems. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as "model collapse" or "data poisoning," occurs when models are trained on outputs of other models, compounding errors and losing alignment with human-authored knowledge and intent.
Solution Overview
The proposed system provides:
Core Metadata Schema

Origin Classification: human, ai, or hybrid
Provenance Tracking: Author, timestamp, creation tools
Integrity Protection: SHA-256 checksums for tamper detection
Licensing Information: Clear usage terms and permissions

Multiple Format Support

XML Sidecars: External metadata files (.meta.xml)
HTTP Headers: X-Content-* headers for web content
HTML Meta Tags: Embedded <meta> tags
Future: Audio ID3v2 tags, Image EXIF/XMP metadata

Validation and Verification

Content Integrity: Cryptographic checksum verification
Schema Compliance: RFC specification validation
Tamper Detection: Identifies modified content
