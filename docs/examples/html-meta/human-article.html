            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of AI-generated content detection in academic publishing. Our research methodology involved manual review of 10,000 academic papers published between 2020-2025, with human reviewers classifying content origin and quality metrics.</p>

        <section class="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Human researchers conducted systematic analysis using established academic review protocols. No AI assistance was used in data collection, analysis, or writing of this manuscript.</p>

        <section class="results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Our findings demonstrate that RFC-compliant metadata systems can effectively distinguish human-authored academic content with 97.3% accuracy when combined with traditional plagiarism detection methods.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Metadata-based content classification represents a promising approach to maintaining academic integrity in the age of generative AI.</p>
